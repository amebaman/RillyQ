The Realest of Real Queues

I guess we can find some server to throw this on.  For languages, I vote Python or Java or Javascript because I know those ones.  We basically want to make a pretty simple database that keeps track of the status of our various work orders and lets us see what's going on most recently, or the latest updates on that one computer that's been sitting on our desk for years.  A miniature Footprints, if you will.
